Dekhte hai loosely translates to let's watch!

This is the usual problem I and my friends face on a movie night, given the plethora of options. To ease the pain of decision making, I created this small app which let's the movie night's decision be left to fate.

Tried to capture the genres and platforms we usually stream from, but also gave the ability to deselect the options which don't apply (or we don't feel like on a given day)
